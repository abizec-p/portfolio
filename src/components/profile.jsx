            Hi, Im Abizec – a passionate web developer and graphic designer from Nepal, now calling Canada home. My journey started when I was 19, diving into the world of web development. Along the way, I made plenty of mistakes, but I have grown with each one, building my craft and finding what truly excites me. I approach everything practically and focus on what works for the client, not rules or trends. Whether its code or design, I bring my passion and curiosity to every project.

            <h1>My Craft
            </h1>
            <p>
            I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, but my expertise doesn’t end there. As a graphic designer, I also blend creativity and functionality in my designs, ensuring they not only look good but also deliver results. I believe in adapting to my clients needs and always strive for practical solutions that exceed expectations. No matter the project, my focus is on creating user-friendly experiences that leave a lasting impression.

            <h1>Beyond the Screen
            </h1>
            <p>When I'm not coding or designing, you’ll likely find me with a camera in hand. Photography is my creative outlet – a way to capture the world around me and bring that same eye for detail to my work. It’s through this lens that I see the beauty in both the smallest and the biggest things, and it constantly inspires the work I do.</p>
            <p>You can see some of my works on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pariyar_abizake/">Instagram</a></p>
            <h1>Why hire me?
            </h1>
            <p>I’m all about bringing ideas to life—whether it’s designing eye-catching visuals, building clean and responsive websites, or capturing great photos. With skills in both design and development, I can handle a project from start to finish. I focus on what works best for you, not just what’s trendy. I’m easy to work with, detail-oriented, and always down to solve creative problems. If you want someone who gets the job done and keeps it real, let’s work together.</p>
